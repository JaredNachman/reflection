How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Instead of looking through each line of code and waiting until you find a line
that doesn't match up, the diff will find the exact lines in the code that are
different and make a list of what was deleted and added.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

If you find a bug in your code you can go back and run the previous versions to
find the most recent version that doesn't have the bug and find out what created
the bug in the next version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

You can systematically create a commit whenever you have made an edit that you
think you may want to go back and see what you did with that edit at a later
time for example when you add a new button to a game.  This is better than the
code being automatically saved because there are less versions to search through
to find the version you need to go back to.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because while coding multiple files may affect one another so saving them at the
same time gives some unity so you can cross reference each from the same commit
if you need to find something that was changed in both at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can use those two commands to pull up two different old versions of a given
file then cross reference them to find the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You can make a commit right before you make a change so if anything happens you
can restore that previous commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I am not exactly sure what I want to use Git for but I think whenever I am
writing code, Git is a good place to store it.
